# ArduinoBombSound
This arduino code produces the sound of a BOMB :)
I personally used and arduino micro
## Pin config
Everything is customizable but this is the deafult config:
- Arduino 5V => Arduino D3 (you should unplug this cable to start the program)
- Arduino D6 => ~ 100 Ohm Resistor => Buzzer +    (Buzzer - goes into GND)
- Arduino GND => Buzzer -   and   LED -
- Arduino D10 => ~ 130 Ohm Resistor => LED +     (LED - goes into GND)
Please note i'm using a red LED. If you are using a LED of another color, you should use a slightly different resistor
